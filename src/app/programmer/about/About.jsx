      I’m a budding horticulturist and epic fantasy novel enthusiast. I have spent the majority of my adult life travelling Canada performing in musical comedies and operas. If the travelling life has taught me one thing; it is the importance of my iPad with Netflix. And a good internet connection. And the support and love of my family. Okay, so I have learnt that life lessons can’t really be boiled down to one, and I am excited to keep learning, growing and occasionally being awesome.
